# Road Accident Analysis Using PySpark

🚦 **Course**: Data Intensive Architectures  
🎓 **Institution**: National College of Ireland  
📄 **Report**: [Final Report - x23189916_DIA_FINAL_REPORT.pdf](report/x23189916_DIA_FINAL_REPORT.pdf)
## 📌 Objective
To analyze road accident data using distributed processing via PySpark. The goal was to uncover patterns and trends to help reduce accidents and improve public safety infrastructure.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Python
- Google Colab / Databricks
- Jupyter Notebooks
- CSV dataset (UK accidents data)

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Accidents distribution by weather, time, day of the week
- Severity classification and heatmaps
- Aggregations using Spark SQL
- Geospatial visualizations (heatmaps for high-risk zones)

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`README.md`**: Overview of the project and instructions.
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset link and data description.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
- **`report/`**: Final project report in PDF format.


## 🧠 Insights
- Most accidents occur under fine weather conditions during daylight — suggesting driver error as a major factor.
- Severity tends to increase in rural areas and under poor visibility.
- Fridays and Saturdays record the highest accident rates.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Include real-time data from traffic APIs
- Integrate with external weather data sources
- Build a prediction model for accident severity
