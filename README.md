# Road-Accident-Analysis
Analyzed UK road accident data using PySpark to identify patterns in accident severity, timing, weather conditions, and location. Leveraged Spark SQL and visualizations to uncover insights for improving road safety and traffic management.

# Road Accident Analysis Using PySpark

🚦 **Course**: Data Intensive Architectures  
🎓 **Institution**: National College of Ireland  
👩‍💻 **Team**: Kiruthika Suresh  
📄 **Report**: [Final Report (PDF)](./report/x23189916_DIA_FINAL_REPORT.pdf)

## 📌 Objective
To analyze road accident data using distributed processing via PySpark. The goal was to uncover patterns and trends to help reduce accidents and improve public safety infrastructure.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Python
- Google Colab / Databricks
- Jupyter Notebooks
- CSV dataset (UK accidents data)

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Accidents distribution by weather, time, day of the week
- Severity classification and heatmaps
- Aggregations using Spark SQL
- Geospatial visualizations (heatmaps for high-risk zones)

## 🧠 Insights
- Most accidents occur under fine weather conditions during daylight — suggesting driver error as a major factor.
- Severity tends to increase in rural areas and under poor visibility.
- Fridays and Saturdays record the highest accident rates.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Include real-time data from traffic APIs
- Integrate with external weather data sources
- Build a prediction model for accident severity
